## Pomodoro Timer
A Pomodor Timer with a built in TODO List to maximize productivity.

## Features
Currently the initial version of the Pomodoro timer is complete. The timer itself allows users to set their focus session length, break length, and long break length. The timer automatically starts a break after every focus session and a long break after every 4th focus session.

## Roadmap
Additional features like setting intervals for the long break will be added to the pomodoro timer in future updates. The focus right now is to implement the MVP for the TODO list portion of the app.
